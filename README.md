# Flight-price-prediction
Flight Price Prediction using Machine Learning. Predicts airfare based on airline, source, destination, duration, and days left.

Project Overview:
	This project focuses on predicting flight booking prices using historical flight data. The objective is to build a predictive model that helps estimate flight prices based on various factors such as airline, departure and arrival times, stops, duration, and the number of days left before the flight. By leveraging data analysis and machine learning techniques, this project aims to provide insights that could help travelers make more informed booking decisions and assist airlines in pricing strategies.

Key Components:

Data Exploration & Preprocessing:
Conducted an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution of key variables, handle missing values, and engineer relevant features.

Modeling:
Implemented several machine learning models, including regression and classification algorithms, to predict flight prices and identify key determinants affecting the pricing.

Evaluation:
Evaluated model performance using metrics such as RMSE, RÂ², and confusion matrices, and addressed challenges like class imbalance and multicollinearity.

Business Insights:
Derived actionable insights from the model results that can guide decision-making for both customers and airlines, highlighting trends and potential areas for pricing optimization.

This end-to-end project not only demonstrates a robust machine learning pipeline but also emphasizes practical business applications by turning data into actionable insights.
